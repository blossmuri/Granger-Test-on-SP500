# Granger Causality Analysis of PMI and S&P 500
 Project Overview

This project aims to explore the potential predictive relationship between the Producer Manager Index (PMI) and the S&P 500 stock index using statistical analysis and time series forecasting techniques. By applying the Granger causality test, we seek to determine whether fluctuations in PMI can be considered a leading indicator for changes in the S&P 500, thereby providing insights that might be beneficial for economic analysts and investors.
